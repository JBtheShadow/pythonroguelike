# Controls
Use arrow keys or the numpad to move. If you're daring enough, or would like diagonals but you don't have a numpad, you can also use the following keys:
* left: h
* down: j
* up: k
* right: l
* up left: y
* up right: u
* down left: b
* down right: n

To wait a turn press z, or numpad 5;

To view your stats press c;

To pick up items from the ground press g;

To use an item press i, and to drop an item press d. On either case it will bring up your inventory. Follow the instructions on the screen;

If you find a > on the map those are down stairs. Press Enter on them to go down a level. < are up stairs but those merely mark that floor's entrance. You can't go back up yet
